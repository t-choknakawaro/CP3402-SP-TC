# **PROJECT REPORT**

## **Project Overview**
This project involved developing a custom **U3A Child Theme** based on the Twenty Twenty-Four parent theme, tailored to the needs of the University of the Third Age (U3A). The goal was to create a site with enhanced accessibility and usability, particularly for an older audience.

## **Technologies and Tools Used**
- **WordPress**: Developed a child theme by extending the functionality of the Twenty Twenty-Four parent theme. Used a lot of plugins in the WordPress.
- **HTML, CSS, PHP**: For customizing the layout and design of the theme.
- **Docker**: To set up a local development environment using `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For hosting and production deployment.
- **Git & GitHub**: Managed version control and collaboration throughout the project.

## **Skills Developed**

### 1. **Full-Stack WordPress Development**
- Customized child themes, extended functionality by PHP, and the design using CSS.

### 2. **Docker and Cloud Hosting**
- Set up local development with Docker and later transitioned to Google Cloud for production hosting.
- Google Cloud and their products like SQL

### 3. **Project Management and Adaptability**
- Adapted to challenges with Docker and managed the transition to Google Cloud for real-time hosting.

## **Key Challenges and Lessons Learned**

### 1. **Docker to Cloud Migration**
- At first, I used Docker for local development, with the `docker-compose.yml` committed to GitHub. Midway through, I switched to Google Cloud for hosting to better handle production challenges.
- During the migration, I faced problems with large file imports to new IP addresses, forcing me to rebuild the site just before the deadline.
- I tried to connect docker to my site after I have done the site again, I tried many ways but none of them work even it seems working.

### 2. **Reworking the Project**
- Migration issues, especially with large WordPress backups, made me restart the project from the beginning. This taught me the value of early deployment and regular testing in live environments.
  
### 3. **Google CLoud**
- It was challenging to use, especially in getting the free credits. Initially, I planned to set it up first, but I couldnâ€™t access the free trial, so I worked on the local site instead. Once I finally got the free trial, I accidentally ended up hosting a new site. Additionally, I used Google Cloud SQL, which turned out to be quite expensive.
  
## **Conclusion**
This project provided valuable experience in WordPress theme development, cloud hosting, and problem-solving. Despite the challenges faced during migration and hosting, the project was completed successfully, and the final result is a fully functional, accessible website. These experiences have strengthened my ability to manage web development projects efficiently.
